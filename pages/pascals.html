        <p class="mb-6">
            As I wandered through a set of algebraic and calculus calculations, I stumbled upon an unexpected
            realization about the renowned Pascal’s Triangle. Known for its elegant additive structure, it’s a shortcut
            I often used for quick coefficient insertions in binomial expansions. But over time, I began to notice its
            limitations—specifically when applying it to more complex polynomial expressions.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
            The challenge surfaced when working on a particularly intricate derivative problem. The expansion required
            wasn’t just a neat <code>(a + x)<sup>n</sup></code> — it had a coefficient on <code>x</code> that wasn't 1.
            That’s when it struck me: “Pascal wasn’t the first to discover this pattern. The triangle’s origins stretch
            across ancient civilizations. Surely, it holds deeper capabilities.”
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
            That thought sparked a two-day deep dive in January 2025, an obsessive but fulfilling search for a
            generalized extension. And I found it. A method that not only adapts to coefficients beyond 1 but does so
            with remarkable efficiency. Compared to the traditional computation methods—which often take half a page—the
            technique I uncovered compresses the work to just under a quarter.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
            On the 21st of January, I finalized the system: an internal model that unlocks what I can only describe as
            the infinite pyramid within Pascal’s Triangle. While modern mathematics has formulas to address this, my
            formulation outperforms them in both clarity and brevity.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
            I haven’t seen this approach documented in textbooks or lectures. But I believe it deserves to be explored
            further, debated, challenged, and — if proven useful — adopted into mainstream learning. Because at the
            heart of math lies not just answers, but the elegant paths we take to find them.
