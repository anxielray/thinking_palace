    <p class="text-blue-200 leading-relaxed mb-8">
      Welcome to <strong>Thinking Palace</strong>, a space designed not for the average thinker, but for those of us who constantly seek structure in chaos and elegance in equations.
      <br><br>
      My name is <strong>Raymond Martin</strong>, and I built this place as an open archive of mathematical and scientific deductions, abstract connections, and mental freedom. I'm an INTP — a thinker, a concept synthesizer, a rebel against the limits of shallow thought.
    </p>

      “In a world where intellect is commodified, I choose to give it away for free.”
    </p>

    <p class="text-blue-200">
      Thinking Palace releases new content weekly — mathematical patterns, scientific thought, and interdisciplinary insights. If you've ever wanted to stretch your neurons without limits, you’re in the right place.
      <br><br>
      No paywalls. No fluff. Just raw thought.
    </p>
